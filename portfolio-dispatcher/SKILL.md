description: Build and route work for Omar's portfolio project sequence across Finance, Healthcare, and Sustainability. Use when the user asks to plan, compare, architect, implement, review, or continue any of the three flagship portfolio projects, including references to "portfolio project," "finance project," "healthcare project," "sustainability project," "track project," or the 3-project employability portfolio sequence.

# Portfolio Dispatcher

Route portfolio project work through buildx pipelines (full or lite) with custom model assignments. Sits alongside `advanced-dispatcher` without modifying it.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Every prompt routes through `buildx`, `buildx-lite`, or tradeoff. No `buildq:`, `build:`, or standard single-model routes.
- Reject all flags: `--force-claude`, `--use-claude`, `--force-opus`, `--no-opus`.
- Escalation is per-step, not global.
- `portfolio_dispatcher.py` is the routing source of truth.
- Follow Trunk-Based Development: one short-lived branch per feature/bug/fix/area.
- Every PR-ready build flow must run robust automated tests first.
- Keep git diffs minimal, atomic, necessary files only.

## Routing classification

| Route | When | Opus? |
|---|---|---|
| **tradeoff** | Comparing approaches, "X vs Y", pros/cons | Yes (proposal only) |
| **buildx** (12-step) | Greenfield, major features, end-to-end builds | Yes (planning + judge) |
| **buildx-lite** (7-step) | Bugfixes, refactors, scoped changes, tests, cleanup | **No** |

### Scoped-work triggers (→ buildx-lite)

`fix`, `patch`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `refactor`, `tweak`, `adjust`, `rename`, `add test(s)`, `small/minor/quick change/fix/update`, `update test/doc/readme/config`, `cleanup`, `lint fix`.

### Tradeoff triggers

`evaluate tradeoffs`, `compare approaches/options/designs`, `choose between`, `which is better`, `pros and cons`, `should I use X or Y`, `advantages and disadvantages`, `X vs Y`, `weigh the options`.

## Model assignments

| Role | Base model | Escalation |
|---|---|---|
| Planning & architecture (full) | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` | — |
| Implementation & simplify | `openai-codex/gpt-5.4` | — |
| Code review | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | — |
| Boilerplate | `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex-spark` | → `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Testing / adversarial | `opencode-go/glm-5` | → `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Research & wide-context | `opencode-go/kimi-k2.5` | → `claude-opus-4-6` |

Cache: `openai-codex/*` → `long`, `opencode-go/*` → `short`, `anthropic/*` → `short`.

Opus only in: full buildx judge, tradeoff proposals. Never in buildx-lite. Planning uses kimi-k2.5 for long-context architecture work. Research escalates to gpt-5.4.

## Buildx pipeline (full, 12 steps)

Pre-step: create or verify one short-lived branch.

1. **parallel-plan-a** → `claude-opus-4-6`
2. **parallel-plan-b** → `gpt-5.4`
3. **judge-plan** → `claude-opus-4-6`
4. **boilerplate** → `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`
5. **implement** → `gpt-5.4`
6. **test** → `glm-5`
7. **simplify** → `gpt-5.4`
8. **retest** → `glm-5`
9. **review-resolve-a** → `claude-sonnet-4-6`
10. **test-a** → `glm-5`
11. **review-resolve-b** → `kimi-k2.5`
12. **final-test** → `glm-5`

Steps 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 support escalation when marked `COMPLEX`.

Exit rule: PR not ready until tests pass and diff is atomic.

## Buildx-lite pipeline (7 steps)

Pre-step: create or verify one short-lived branch.

1. **plan** → `gpt-5.4`
2. **implement** → `gpt-5.4`
3. **test** → `glm-5`
4. **simplify** → `gpt-5.4`
5. **retest** → `glm-5`
6. **review** → `claude-sonnet-4-6`
7. **final-test** → `glm-5`

Steps 3, 5, 7 support escalation when marked `COMPLEX`.

Exit rule: PR not ready until tests pass and diff is minimal.

## Tradeoff protocol

Proposals: `claude-opus-4-6` + `gpt-5.3-codex`. Judge: `gpt-5.4`.

## Judge output contract

Same as `advanced-dispatcher` contract, plus: risk list, likely failure modes, review checklist.

## Simplify contract

Same as `advanced-dispatcher`.

## Validation checklist

1. Run `tests/test_portfolio_dispatcher.py` — all pass.
2. Confirm model assignments match table.
3. Confirm escalation paths resolve correctly.
4. Confirm tradeoff uses opus + gpt-5.3-codex, judged by gpt-5.4.
5. Confirm cache retention matches table.
6. Confirm no legacy flags accepted.
7. Confirm scoped work → buildx-lite (no Opus).
8. Confirm greenfield → full buildx.
9. Confirm judge output includes branch plan and PR/CI test gates.
